1. Here are ways in which Game Central adheres to or aims to adhere to universal design principles:
    a) Equitable Use
        - The Program presents game information in a consistent layout
        - Each user is able to access the same features
            - search, lists, profile, etc.

    b) Flexibility in Use
        - Users are able to search games by both names and their genres 
        - We could add a voice search feature or similar to improve our adherence to this design principle.

    c) Simple and Intuitive Use
        - The UI has simple and labeled buttons on its navigation bar, allowing new users to easily use the program.
        - Not too complicated to use and users can easily find their way through the program.

    d) Perceptible Information
        - Various information is provided to the user in the form of different game details
        - Images are also provided to help give players a visual idea of what a game is like
        - A future improvement to improve adherence to this principle could be adding an alt text to images feature
            - or different viewing modes such as color blind modes or high contrast mode for visually impaired users

    e) Tolerance for Error
        - Searches that have no results clearly display that with an appropriate message
    
    f) Low Physical Effort
        - The UI of the program minimizes the need for any complicated actions that may require various clicks
        - Reduces the physical effort for user as they do not have to make many clicks
        - A future imporvement to improve adherence to this priniciple could be adding keyboard shortcuts to make 
        the navigation even better

    g) Size and Space for Approach and Use
        - The buttons are sized well enough so that users can easily click them.
        - This reduces the need for very precise inputs.
        - A future improvement to better adhere to this principle could be a feature like button resizing





2. This program Game Central has a very clear target audience, gamers. As gamers ourselves, we wanted a way to keep 
track of our massive game libraries. As many people own many games across various platforms, it's really easy to 
forget what you own and what you do not own. Similarly, once you are done playing games you own, it can be hard to 
find new games to play. That is where our program Game Central comes in. It appeals to its target audience of gamers 
by allowing them to find a way to manage their existing game libraries, find new games to play, and also interact 
with other gamers by seeing what they are playing. Features like these and more, allow Game Central to appeal to 
its target audience in a very personal way.

3. This program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. These could likely include people without access to 
a good internet connection. Considering our program relies heavily on internet connection, it will be very hard to use 
without it. Additionally, people with visual impairments such as blindness will have a hard time using the application.
This could likely be fixed by a screen reader. However, currently we do not have that in our program. Finally, 
considering our program displays everything in English, non-English speakers would have a hard time using our program.
It would not be accessible to them due to the clear language barrier.
